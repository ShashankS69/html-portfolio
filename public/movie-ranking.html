    <h1>The Best Movies According to me</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p> A good superhero crossover, liked it that they included every single MCU superheros in that movie.<br/>
    After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins.<br/>
    With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe.</p>
<h3>Justice League: Snyder's cut </h3>
<p> Way better than the actual Justice League movie.<br/>
    Determined to ensure that Superman's ultimate sacrifice wasn't in vain, Bruce Wayne recruits a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions.</p>
<h3>Spider-Man:Accross the spiderverse</h3>
<p> An extremely good animated movie which was packed with action and  very pleasing to watch.<br/>Miles Morales catapults across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence.<br/> 
    When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero.
